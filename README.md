
### Trim File (Java)

by: Keith Fenske, https://kwfenske.github.io/

TrimFile is a Java 1.4 console application to remove trailing white space
(blanks or tabs) from the end of each line in a plain text file. Extra spaces
commonly accumulate while editing source programs in a graphical compiler
(IDE). They aren't a problem, but they do waste file space and occasionally
affect the appearance of programs. Many character sets (encodings) are
supported, and you may convert between character sets or newline styles.

There is no graphical interface (GUI) for this program; it must be run from a
command prompt, command shell, or terminal window.
